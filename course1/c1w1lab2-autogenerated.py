# This code is a simple machine learning workflow that includes data preparation, model prediction, loss calculation, training, evaluation, and model saving/loading.
# It uses dummy implementations for the model prediction, training, and evaluation functions.
# In a real-world scenario, these functions would contain the actual logic for training a machine learning model.
# The code is structured to demonstrate the basic flow of a machine learning task, including data handling and function definitions.
# The code is designed to be easily extensible for future improvements or modifications.
# The code is written in Python and uses the NumPy library for numerical operations.
# The code is intended for educational purposes, particularly for a course on machine learning.
# The code is organized into functions to encapsulate different parts of the machine learning workflow.
# The code includes print statements to provide feedback on the progress of the training and evaluation process.
# The code is designed to be run as a standalone script, with a main function that orchestrates the workflow.
# The code is structured to be clear and easy to understand, making it suitable for beginners in machine learning.
# The code is a simple example of a machine learning pipeline, demonstrating the basic steps involved in training and evaluating a model.
# The code is not intended for production use and serves as a basic template for learning purposes.
